## First and foremost

Vue Web Scraping for SEO project (Vue WSC-SEO) is a project created with the aim of researching and applying the advantages of web scraping to support SEO for Vue projects. It is not intended for commercial purposes and is not allowed to be used for commercialization. Vue WSC-SEO is considered a choice for SEO automation purposes, in addition to providing SSR capabilities for CSR-only frameworks such as VueJS (there is a version for Vue, see [here](https://github.com/anhchangvt1994/webpack-project-template-vue__seo-web-scraping)) and does not require comparison or replacement for current Frontend meta frameworks such as Next, Nuxt, Rmix, SvelteKit, etc.

<h3 id="what">What is Vue Web Scraping for SEO ?</h3>
Web Scraping for SEO project (Vue WSC-SEO) is a product designed for VueJS developers who have SEO needs but do not want to use Frontend meta frameworks for personal reasons. For those developers, Vue WSC-SEO would be a suitable choice. Vue WSC-SEO helps frontend developers focus only on processing business code and not worry about anything else beyond the limits of a VueJS framework. It eliminates the need to worry about

- How to SEO with just VueJS usage ?
- How to optimize SEO ? (block scripts, block resources, large images, need some attributes to make tag valid ...)
- When run the business code ? (on server side or client side ?)

**What is SEO automation ?** You can see the below example (the top frame I use website with WSC-SEO and the bottom is a website without WSC-SEO), all of the scores of website is increase when use WSC-SEO for SEO automation.

<h3 id="more">More information</h3>

**> Why use this project ?**

<p>As introduced above, Vue WSC-SEO provides VueJS developers with an additional option for easy access and SEO optimization if needed. To provide developers with more information about the product and make a more informed decision about its use, Vue WSC-SEO will provide the following specific advantages and disadvantages:</p>

Advantages:

- Provides ISR capabilities for CSR-only VueJS frameworks (without VueJS SSR create feature)
- Provides automation in optimizing for the entire Lighthouse score
- Helps developers focus entirely on business code without worrying about server code

Disadvantages:

- Cannot deliver complete results on free serverless platforms (such as Vercel), because free serverless platforms often have lower bandwidth, serverless timeout, and storage capacity than paid versions. Therefore, Web Scraping features (a key feature of this product) cannot run at their best capacity when deployed on production.

**> How to setup meta SEO tags ?**

I already created utils for this necessary, you just type **setSeoTag** for all setup or **setMeta[X]** for each meta seo tag

```typescript
// NOTE - Setup for all
setSeoTag({
	title: 'Home page',
	keywords: 'Home page, vue 3, wsc-seo',
	description: 'Home page Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:type': 'website',
	'og:title': 'Home page',
	'og:description': 'Home page Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:url': window.location.pathname,
	'og:site_name': 'Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:image': '',
	'og:image:width': '1200',
	'og:image:height': '628',
	robots: 'index, follow',
})

// NOTE - Setup for each
setMetaKeywordsTag('Home page')
setMetaRobotsTag('index, follow')
setMetaDescriptionTag('Home page Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO')
```

**> How to setup link SEO tags ?**

I already created utils for this necessary, you just type **setSeoTag** for all setup or **setLink[X]** for each meta seo tag

```javascript
// NOTE - Setup for all
setSeoTag({
	title: 'Home page',
	keywords: 'Home page, vue 3, wsc-seo',
	description: 'Home page Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:type': 'website',
	'og:title': 'Home page',
	'og:description': 'Home page Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:url': window.location.pathname,
	'og:site_name': 'Vue 3.x and WSC-SEO',
	'og:image': '',
	'og:image:width': '1200',
	'og:image:height': '628',
	robots: 'index, follow',
})

// NOTE - Setup for each
setLinkTwitterTitleTag('Home page')
```

**> How to setup redirect ?**

I already prepared a configuration file to support for redirect case, this configuration file placed in **./server/src/app/redirect.config.ts**

In this configuration file we have 2 types of setup :

1. Static configuration

Use it when you just need to redirect from original path to new path and this path just is a string and no need to detect by using regex.

```typescript
export interface IRedirectInfoItem {
	statusCode: number
	path: string
	targetPath: string
}

// NOTE - Declare redirects
export const REDIRECT_INFO: IRedirectInfoItem[] = [
	// NOTE - redirect from pathname /test to pathname / with status code 302
	{
		path: '/test',
		targetPath: '/',
		statusCode: 302,
	},
]
```

2. Dynamic configuration

Use it when you need handle more logics before redirect. (Coming soon feature)

```typescript
import { Request } from 'express'

// NOTE - Declare redirect middleware
export const REDIRECT_INJECTION = (req: Request) => {} // REDIRECT_INJECTION
```

**> What is BotInfo variable ?**

<p><b>BotInfo</b> is a variable keep the Bot information which sent from server to client. You can use it to decide render / none render component if it is Bot / not Bot.</p>

```typescript
interface IBotInfo {
	isBot: boolean
	name: string
}
```

**> What is DeviceInfo variable ?**

<p><b>DeviceInfo</b> is a variable keep the Device information which sent from server to client. You can use it to create adaptive website.</p>

```typescript
interface IDeviceInfo {
	type: string
	isMobile: string | boolean
	os: string
}
```

<h3 id="deploy">Deploy guide information for testing</h3>

**> First discussion**

In reality, you can use the default Chrome Lighthouse extension of the Chromium browser to test the Google page speed of your product, but there are cases where your browser has extensions that directly affect the website loading process, causing Lighthouse to provide inaccurate results. In those cases, you can use the following solutions:

1. Open an incognito window to disable extensions (usually extensions will not run in incognito windows)
2. Manually turn off extensions through the browser's extension management
3. Deploy the product to a hosting, VPS or free Node.js serverless that you know and use Google test page speed to measure. (As mentioned above, free services often have a minimum limit on capacity, so they may not provide expected results compared to testing in local or paid environments).

For solution 3 (deploying the product), I will guide you on how to deploy the product to Render.

**> Some environment variables must know for server side setup**

> At the moment, you can setup it in configuration section / file of server or cross-env in package start script

- **MAX_WORKERS** ( default: 7 ): the maximum number of workers allowed to be created in a process, usually 4 is a suitable number of workers for paid services, and 7 workers are usually used for local environments. More workers will help the application process more processes in parallel, thereby improving performance. However, if the hardware or service cannot meet that number, it is best to consider choosing 2 or 4 workers to ensure that the process is not adversely affected by too many workers compared to the hardware's capability, causing process congestion.
- **DURATION_TIMEOUT** ( default: 20000ms -> 20s ) : the total time allowed for a request to be maintained and processed. After this time, all processing will be released to avoid memory leaks. For Vercel's free version, this timeout will be 10s, after 10s, the serverless function will be closed and all processes will be released
- **POWER_LEVEL** ( default: 3 ) : the utility level that the service can use, including 3 levels, the lower the level, the more limited utilities such as optimize, waiting for full content, etc. This is to ensure output results for free services used for testing with limited hardware.
- **DISABLE_COMPRESS_HTML** ( default: false ) : don't need compress html after get finish
- **DISABLE_DEEP_OPTIMIZE** ( default: false ) : don't need deep optimize for SEO (you will do that in your business code that don't need the WSC-SEO support)
- **SERVER_LESS** ( default: false ) : declaring that the program is running on a serverless and needs to process processes according to the characteristics of a serverless function.
- **BANDWIDTH_LEVEL** ( default: 2 ) : the service's bandwidth level used to run the product, with 2 levels. Level 1 corresponds to low bandwidth and requires time adjustment so that Web Scraping does not run out of time and cause missing content. Level 2 is good bandwidth level that can meet smooth running of the product.
- **NOT_FOUND_PAGE_ID** ( default: "404-page" ) : Normally, CRS + SPA websites will always return a status code of 200, even for the 404 page. To help the system identify a 404 page, you need to place an ID in the 404 page. The system will scan the content of the website and determine if it is a 404 page or not. By default, the system will use the ID "404-page" to identify it.

Some environment variables are used for definition during the declaration process before deployment, such as:

- **BASE_URL** (optional but necessary when using on Vercel): Because Vercel provides dynamic domains during request processing, we need to define which domain is the main domain of the project for Vercel to understand.
  when you deploy vercel, vercel will ask you name for your project. After that, vercel will use that name and create an domain like this format: https://project-name.vercel.app. All you need to do is set BASE_URL env value like this domain.
- **ENV** If you want to test the project, please define ENV as "staging". Conversely, ENV will automatically understand that the environment is "production".

<h4>Deploy and Test in <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render</a> ( an unified cloud )</h4>

**Step-by-step**

- Choose **Dashboard** > Choose **new** > choose **Web service**
- Choose **Build and deploy from a Git repository** and choose **Next** after that
- Choose the repository that you need to deploy from VCS (version control software) you connected before.
- Setup like image below :

- Scroll down and choose **Advance** > choose **Add Environment Variable** to setup Environment.

![alt text](/src/assets/static/images/readme/bandwidth-variable.jpg 'Deploy Render')

Because the resource of free paid will have a lowest of power (lowest bandwidth, lowest CPU, lowest capacity, .etc). So that we need to notice for project know about that, project will compute base on that information to ensure the puppeteer SEO automation work well.
